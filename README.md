# Risk analysis

"Risico analyse" is a web application written in the framework [Ember](https://ember-cli,com/). This is made for Garage 2020, a Dutch company that collects data and creates datasets. This application is made to calculate and analyze this data to create an number/precentage that can be used as an impartial view on the situation. These outcomes can be an indication for them to intervene with the case that they are working on at that moment. The page saves itself in the local storage so nothing is lost on refresh/browsing and of course deletes the information on form reset.

## Concept

A big form. The form dynamically creates itself from a database/json file. It also creates tabs for categories so you can easily switch between the subject you want to add the values for. On the right side you can always get the calculated result of your currently selected values. This is also the place for one or several buttons since this section follows you around the page. One of these buttons is a reset, the other is a print-button to create a printerfriendly version of the form. The page also has a searchbar so you can search for a specific label or words in a label. This makes entering values easy.

## Process

I started this project not knowing anything about Ember. After following the [Ember Quick Start Guide](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/quick-start/) I learned how to create an application, about routes, components and how to deploy the [app](https://righteous-dinosaurs.surge.sh/scientists).

With my recently gained knowledge I started by reading more about the models, components, controllers, routing and all that. This gave me some confidence in starting the actual application.

I started with dynamically creating the form from a JSON-file, which turned out to be rather easy. After that I used Mirage to fake api/db calls. This was well documented on their [website](https://ember-cli-mirage.com/).
Making the searchbar was not as difficult as I expected thanks to the Ember Tutorial I did earlier on. It still took a full day to get both these components up and running.

Putting all the data in the localStorage and retrieving it turned out to be quite a bit more difficult. The searchbar made it so I had to filter and then retrieve the data every single time. This took me more than a day with adding a component for the reset button as well.

Calculating the riskpercentage after that was quite easy since everything was already in place for getting the localdata, I just had to calculate with that as soon as it was retrieved.

There's a lot of temporary/ugly solutions to a couple of problems that I wish I had time to fix such as duplicate functions and a timeout for retrieving the data from Mirage.
